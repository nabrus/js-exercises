    The 7th primitive type, symbol. The others being string, number, 
    object, boolean, null, and undefined.

    Symbols are unique identifiers, that help avoid naming collisions. 
    So they can be used when creating a property in a unique way for 
    example. 
  */

  const steve = Symbol("Steve");  // "Steve" being a descriptor, not a value
  const person = Symbol("Steve"); // Same descriptor but both are unique.

  // steve === person -> false
  // steve == person  -> also false

  // The following shows using Symbol for like data, making the 
  // 'Olivia's unique from each other. 
  const classRoom = {
    [Symbol("Jeff")]: { grade: 50, gender: "male" },
    [Symbol("Olivia")]: { grade: 80, gender: "female" },
    [Symbol("Olivia")]: { grade: 80, gender: "female" },
  } 

  // Note: Symbols are NOT enumerable, so they cannot be looped over.

  for(person in classRoom) {
    console.log(person); // Nothing will log
  }
  // Because of this, it's sometimes used to store private data.

  // To get access to Symbols, getOwnPropertySymbols is used.
  const syms = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(classRoom); 
  // syms stores an array of the Symbols
  const data = syms.map(sym => classRoom[sym]);
  console.log(data); // accesses the data of each Symbol

  /*
    MDN definition:
    The data type "symbol" is a primitive data type having the quality 
    that, values of this type can be used to make object properties that 
    are anonymous. This data type is used as the key for an object 
    property when the property is intended to be private, for the internal 
    use of a class or an object type. For example, keys of type symbol 
    exist in various built-in JavaScript objects. Similarly, custom classes 
    can also create private members this way. The symbol data type is 
    highly specialized in purpose, and remarkable for its lack of 
    versatility; an instance of Symbol can be assigned to an L-value, 
    it can be examined for identity, and that's all; no other operators 
    apply. (Contrast this with an instance of "Number", for example the 
    integer "42", which has a panoply of operators that compare or combine 
    the value with others of its type.)
