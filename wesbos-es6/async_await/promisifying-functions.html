      How to use promises when only callbacks are used.

      An example using Navigator.geolocation* which is an older API that
      is callback based.

        *The Navigator.geolocation read-only property returns a Geolocation
        object that gives Web content access to the location of the device.
        This allows a Web site or app to offer customized results based on the
        user's location.

    // How it is used now with callbacks
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(pos) {
      console.log("Allowed");
    }, function(err) {
        console.log("Request denied!");
    });
