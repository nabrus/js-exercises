  /*
    The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) 
    of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

    Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach 
    callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

  /*
    The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing 
    and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and 
    responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides
    an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the 
    network.

  /*
    The then() method returns a Promise. It takes up to two arguments: 
    callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise.
  */

   /*
    The catch() method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only. 
    It behaves the same as calling Promise.prototype.then(undefined, 
    onRejected) (in fact, calling obj.catch(onRejected) internally calls 
    obj.then(undefined, onRejected)). This means, that you have to 
    provide onRejected function even if you want to fallback to undefined 
    result value - for example obj.catch(() => {}).
