    /*
      str.padStart(targetLength [, padString])

      The padStart() method pads the current string with another string
      (multiple times, if needed) until the resulting string reaches the given
      length. The padding is applied from the start (left) of the current
      string.

    // .padStart(..) basic example with just targetLength
    "steve".padStart(10);
    // output: "     steve"

    // using the second arg, padStringâ€”what to pad it with
    // note: space is the default padString
    "steve".padStart(10, "*");
    // output: "*****steve"

    /*
      str.padEnd(targetLength [, padString])

      The padEnd() method pads the current string with a given string
      (repeated, if needed) so that the resulting string reaches a given
      length. The padding is applied from the end (right) of the current
      string.

    "steve".padEnd(10);
    // output: "steve     "
    
    // With second arg (padString)
    "steve".padEnd(10, "-");
    // output: "steve-----"

    // some examples
    // const strings = ["short", "medium size", "this is really really long"];
