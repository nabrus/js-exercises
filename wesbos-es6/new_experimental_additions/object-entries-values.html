    /*
      The Object.keys() method returns an array of a given object's own
      property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop.

      The Object.values() method returns an array of a given object's own
      enumerable property values, in the same order as that provided by a
      for...in loop (the difference being that a for-in loop enumerates
      properties in the prototype chain as well).

      The Object.entries() method returns an array of a given object's own
      enumerable property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that
      provided by a for...in loop (the difference being that a for-in loop
      enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well) . The order of the
      array returned by Object.entries() does not depend on how an object is
      defined. If there is a need for certain ordering then the array needs to
      be sorted first like Object.entries(obj).sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);.
