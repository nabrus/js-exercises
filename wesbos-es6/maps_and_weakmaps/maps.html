  /*
    The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion
    order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive* values) may be
    used as either a key or a value.

      * A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not
      an object and has no methods. In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data
      types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol. All primitives
      are immutable.

    Syntax: new Map([iterable])
