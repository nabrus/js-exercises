  /*
    The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion
    order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be
    used as either a key or a value.

    And just like the garbage collection of a WeakSet, a WeakMap is pretty
    much exactly the same.

    A WeakMap doesn't have a size, and you can never tell how many elements
    are in it. A WeakMap is not enumerable, which means you cannot loop over
    it. The items inside of a WeakMap, if they no longer exist anywhere else
    in your application, they will get garbage collected and they'll be
    removed from your WeakMap.
