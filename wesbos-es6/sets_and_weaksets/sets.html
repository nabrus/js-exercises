  /*
    Description:
    Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements
    of a set in insertion order. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is
    unique in the Set's collection.

    The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive*
    values or object references.

    *A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an
    object and has no methods. In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types:
    string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol. All primitives are
    immutable.

    So, a set in JavaScript is like a unique array, meaning that you can only
    ever add the same item once, with a nice API for managing the items inside
    of it. It's different than an array, in that you can't access the items
    individually and it's not index based.

    You can think of a set as just a list of items, which we can add to,
    remove from, and loop over.

  const people = new Set();
  people.add("Steve");
  people.add("Wyatt");
  people.add("Rubble");
