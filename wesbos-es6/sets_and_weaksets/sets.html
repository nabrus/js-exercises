  /*
    The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive*
    values or object references.

      * A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not
      an object and has no methods. In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data
      types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol. All primitives
      are immutable.

    Description:
    Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements
    of a set in insertion order. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is
    unique in the Set's collection.

    So, a set in JavaScript is like a unique array, meaning that you can only
    ever add the same item once, with a nice API for managing the items inside
    of it. It's different than an array, in that you can't access the items
    individually and it's not index based. For example, `.size` is used instead
    of `.length`.

    You can think of a set as just a list of items, which we can add to,
    remove from, and loop over.

  // Syntax: new Set([iterable]);

  const people = new Set();
  people.add("Steve");
  people.add("Wyatt");
  people.add("Rubble");

  /*
    people.remove("Steve") - removes items
    people.clear() - clears the entire set, giving an empty set
  */

  // Other methods can be called for example `people.values()`
  // giving the set's properties as `set iterator` which can be
  // looped over. SetIterator is a kind of `generator`. So the generator API
  // can be used: `.next()` or `for...of` loops
  for (const person of people) {
    console.log(person);
  }
  /* 
    Steve
    Wyatt
    Rubble
  */

  // Declaring a `Set` with the values in it. Notice values are wrapped
  // in an iterable (array, array-ish obj, another set, etc).
  const students = new Set(["Steve", "Wyatt", "R2 D2"]);

  // Passing in an array when creating a `Set`.
  const dogs = ["Rubble", "Rocky", "Chase", "Sky"];
  const dogSet = new Set(dogs);

  // Using `.has(...)`
  console.log(dogSet.has("Rocky")); // true
  console.log(dogSet.has("Skies")); // false

  // Reminder, sets are not index based. So the following does not
  // return "Wyatt".
  console.log(students[1]); // undefined
