    "One use case for generators is the ability to do waterfall-like Ajax
    requests. You've probably run into a situation before where you first 
    need to hit an Ajax request where you search for something, and then when
    that search comes back, it maybe gives you a user ID. Given that ID, you
    have to hit a second Ajax request based on that ID. When that comes back,
    maybe you get a list of photos for that user, and you need specific 
    information about the first photo, or something that came back based on 
    that photo ID."

    /search/wes -> /user/123 -> /photo/456

    "It's kind of like a waterfall. We need the information from the previous 
    one in order to do the next one. You know that that can lead to what's 
    called callback hell, where you have nested code inside of each other. 
    There's libraries like async that are really good for dealing with that,
    however the browser is getting much better at being able to do it 
    natively. We're going to look at an example of how you can do it with 
    generators."

  // Three ajax requests being made in an execute, stop, execute, stop,
  // execute, and stop fashion. Using `yield` on the result of the ajax
  // request, in order to wait on the result before running the next.  

  function ajax(url) {
    fetch(url).then(data => data.json()).then(data => dataGen.next(data));
  }

  function* steps() {
    const beers = yield ajax('http://api.react.beer/v2/search?q=hops&type=beer');
    console.log(beers);

    console.log("Fetching wes");
    const wes = yield ajax('https://api.github.com/users/wesbos');
    console.log(wes);

    console.log("Fetching fatJoe");
    const fatJoe = yield ajax('https://api.discogs.com/artists/51988');
    console.log(fatJoe)
  }

  // Create generator
  const dataGen = steps();
  dataGen.next(); // kicks off the first ajax request

  // So, for example, when you need data from the first 
  // request in the second request it works because the code is yielding until
  // first returns results.
