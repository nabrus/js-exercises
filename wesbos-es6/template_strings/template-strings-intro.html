  /*
    Template literals are string literals allowing embedded 
    expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string 
    interpolation features with them. They were called "template strings" 
    in prior editions of the ES2015 specification.

    Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated 
    by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}). The 
    expressions in the placeholders and the text between them 
    get passed to a function. The default function just concatenates 
    the parts into a single string.
  */

  const name = 'Mose';
  const age = 10;
  // Concatenating variables in strings...
  const sentence = 'My cat ' + name + ' is ' + (age * 4 + 17) + ' years old in cat years.';
  // Template literals (Template strings), enclosed by back-ticks (``)...
  const newSentence = `My cat ${name} is ${age * 4 + 17} years old in cat years.`

  console.log(sentence);    // My cat Mose is 57 years old in cat years.
  console.log(newSentence); // My cat Mose is 57 years old in cat years.

  // NOTE: you can run JS inside of template literals, just like 
  // in the age expression in `sentence`. So, expressions, functions, etc.
