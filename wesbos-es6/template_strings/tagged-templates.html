  /*
    A more advanced form of template literals are tagged templates. 
    Tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The 
    first argument of a tag function contains an array of string 
    values. The remaining arguments are related to the expressions. 
    In the end, your function can return your manipulated string 
    (or it can return something completely different). The name of 
    the function used for the tag can be whatever you want.
  */

  /*
    Function run by the browser with all the info provided in 
    the template string (the strings—text in-between the variables,
    the values, etc), runs logic, and returns what `sentence` 
    will actually be equal to. 

    Note: the value of the strings array is always one more than 
    the value of the values array. For instance, even if there 
    was no string after ${age}, `strings: Array[3]` would still
    show in console. And it would list the third as empty ("").

  function highlight(strings, ...values) { // ...rest parameter syntax
    let str = "";
    strings.forEach((string, i) => {
      str += string + (values[i] || ""); // last one in loop would be undefined.
    });                                  // see note above
    return str;
  }

  // Example showing you can return anything—output: cool

  // function highlight() {
  //   return 'cool';  
  // }

  const name = 'Mose';
  const age = 10;
  // Placing the name of the function (highlight) in front of 
  // the template string is called `tagging` it.
  const sentence = highlight`My cat's name is ${name} and he is ${age} years old`;
  console.log(sentence);
