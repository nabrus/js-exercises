  /*
    The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental
    operations (e.g. property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function
    invocation, etc).

    handler
      Placeholder object which contains traps.

    traps
      The methods that provide property access. This is analogous to the concept of traps in operating systems.

    target
      Object which the proxy virtualizes. It is often used as storage backend
      for the proxy. Invariants (semantics that remain unchanged) regarding
      object non-extensibility or non-configurable properties are verified
      against the target.

    Syntax: `var p = new Proxy(target, handler);`

    Parameters
    `target`
      A target object to wrap with Proxy. It can be any sort of object,
      including a native array, a function or even another proxy.

    `handler`
      An object whose properties are functions which define the behavior
      of the proxy when an operation is performed on it.
  */

  // Again, Proxies allow you to overwrite the default behavior for many
  // of an object's default operations.
  const person = { name: "Steve", age: 100 };
  const personProxy = new Proxy(person, {
    get(target, name) {
      // console.log("Someone is asking for ", target, name);
      return target[name].toUpperCase(); // STEVEN
    },

    set(target, name, value) {
      if (typeof value === "string") {
        target[name] = value.trim() + "   :P";
      }
    }
  });

  personProxy.name = "Steven";
  personProxy.cool = "     oohhhh snap    ";
